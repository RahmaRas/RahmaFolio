🌡️ Temperature Estimation Project

This project predicts **temperature** from weather features using multiple machine learning models and feature selection methods.

---

 📊 Project Workflow
- **Data Cleaning & EDA**: Removed missing values, renamed columns, explored feature correlations.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Applied PCA and SelectKBest for dimensionality reduction.  
- **Modeling**: Compared Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVR.  
- **Evaluation**: Used cross-validation and metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²).  

---

🚀 Results
- **Linear Regression**: Baseline model performance.  
- **Random Forest**: Improved accuracy with ensemble learning.  
- **SVR + Feature Selection**: Best tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability.  

*(You can update with your actual RMSE/MAE values here.)*
